# Volusia County Data Security Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is developed for the Volusia County Sheriff's Office as part of a data security analysis internship. The purpose of the project is to collect network log data from Cisco Firepower FMC, convert it from PDF to CSV, clean and organize the data, and then map the IP addresses to geolocations using Python scripts.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts data from PDF reports.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and organizes the extracted data into a usable format.
- **Geolocation Mapping**: Maps IP addresses to their geographical locations and visualizes them in an HTML file using Folium.

## Project Structure
- `script.py`: The main script that processes and maps the data.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
